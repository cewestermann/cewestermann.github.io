title: From Econometrics To Graph Machine Learning - An Introduction
---


# {{ page.title }}

Welcome to the first ever post of this blog, glad to have you! In this post, I'll give an introduction to the first series of posts that I'll put out. As you've likely noticed from the title, it'll be about my personal educational journey from the field of Econometrics to the world of Graph Theory and Representation Learning. 

### So, why Graph Machine Learning?

I've worked with Machine Learning (ML) for a long time now, mostly related to computer vision and natural language processing. While it has given me a lot of insight into the field and helped me improve both theoretically and applied, it is hard to apply directly to the world of economics. 

I then came across graph ML at the same time that I was introduced to graph theory via a course in Causality, a field very much applicable in economics. It was the combination of my general interest in graph theory, its applications within economics and finally, the potential it shows within ML as well as Deep Learning (DL) that convinced me to pursue this path.


### The first series

I'll release a series of posts regarding this whole endeavour in the near future. The initial posts will be about the role of graph theory within causality and the connections to ML, DL and Reinforcement Learning (RL). We will discuss Structural Causal Models (SCM) and their corresponding graphs as well as how interventions can help us identify the direction of cause and effect (we'll get into all this). 

Econometricians value inference considerably more that prediction power. While prediction power remains relevant, we are usually more interested in effects following some treatment (not necessarily medical). This also means that many of our methods do not offer much flexibility as you sacrifice inference capabilities as you turn to more and more complex models. You can probably imagine an ordinary linear regression using least squares is one of the most interpretable models, but lack flexibility. At the other end of the spectrum, you have support vector machines with radial kernels as well as deep neural networks. If you do not have any experience with these methods, we'll come across them.


### Disclaimer

I added this disclaimer in the About-section as well, but I'll put it here too. This is an educational journal, meaning that I have not taught these subjects and most of them are unfamiliar to me. I will talk about how I perceive the various topics and I am learning as I go, the same as you. I hope that my experiences can help you learn as much as it can me.

Comments and feedback are very welcome! :)
