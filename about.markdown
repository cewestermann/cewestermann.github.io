Hi there! I'm Christian Westermann, a PhD-student in Econometrics.
Since starting my PhD, I've pivoted more towards the fields of Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science, as I believe there are valuable things to learn that can help push the field of Econometrics. While many statistical and mathematical concepts are familiar, there have been and are still tons of unfamiliar subjects and areas to learn. I've learned from experience that teaching really takes my understanding of a subject to another level. That is why I've created this website, to share my understanding of these areas and consequently improve my own learning. 

Content will mainly be about my ML-journey but I've developed a large curiosity within the field of Computer Science, so it's likely that I'll share other stuff that might deviate from the main topics. 

I hope you enjoy! :)
