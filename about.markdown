Hi there! I'm Christian Westermann.

I'm a PhD-student in Econometrics and Machine Learning. I have a Masters in Economics and have been working with Machine Learning (ML) since my Bachelors thesis, which makes it about five years. During my PhD, I've been a teaching assistant as well as lecturer in multiple courses in statistical learning, data-driven decision making and natural language processing. 

As time passed, my interest in ML as well as Computer Science (CS) did all but diminish. As a consequence, I am now several feet deep into these (non-exhaustable) fields and this blog will serve as a sort of educational journal. I know from first-hand experience that teaching increases my own understanding of the subject manyfold which is why I've decided to share my progress. 

A quick disclaimer: I might have taught courses in ML but the topics that I post about on this blog will be largely unfamiliar to me. I use the posts as a way of cementing my understanding as well as share how i perceive things. As such, the content of this blog should not be viewed as the ground truth. I am learning this alongside you, so please remain critical.

Content posted here will mainly be about topics in ML (and specifically Graph Representation Learning to begin with), but I might sneak in a few unrelated posts about CS-related things that I find interesting. (I recently dove into Structural Interpretation of Computer Programs, but I might have to read it over a few times before I post anything, yikes.)

Anyway, I hope you enjoy! :)
